The Instagram Feed module is super simple to set up and allows you to directly access the photos you posted in your Instagram timeline.

Benefits of this module:

    Increase Social Engagments
    Customize the way you display your Instagram photos
    Automated way of posting fresh content
    Hassle-free set up
    Automatic connection to your Instagram account

+++ How to set up the Instagram Feed module? +++

1. Get your Instagram Access Token here: http://instagram.pixelunion.net/

2. Paste the Access Token into HubSpot module field "Access Token"

Note: this feed module uses a third party website to generate an access token for the Instagram API. This 3rd party is not supported by HubSpot, therefore, if there are any questions feel free to reach out to us at InboundLabs.
